As part of an assignment in Exploratory Data Analytics and Visualization course I created a [CHORD DIAGRAM](https://shubhstiws.github.io/interactive_transfer_chart.html)

## Situation:

In one of my exploratory assignment I got an opportunity to analysize a huge european soccer database availlable on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer) 

## Intuition:

During my analysis one hypothesis was that a team's performance in premier league varied due to too many transfer of key players among the teams. To visualize this in an easy manner I selected the top teams across all leagues and created a chord diagram based on the transfer of players among them

## Interactions:

Hovering on a chord reveals the number of transfers

## Insights:

1. The length of band arc denotes the total number of transfers (to and from) from a club to other clubs. Notice the length of Chelsea’s arc. Chelsea had the highest number of transfers

2. The various chords connecting to other clubs shows the transfers and their width is determined by the number of transfers occurring, Chelsea had a lot of movement occurring to multiple clubs like Liverpool, Manchester City

3. Another thing to notice is that there are almost no league boundaries when it comes to transfers. Players frequently move to different leagues, perhaps the perception of EPL being a prestigious league is dominated by the exorbitant salaries offered (Neymar’s recent transfer to PSG in a record 200M and multiple transfers to Chinese Super league also reinforce this belief)

## Limitations:

1. This chart offers no information regarding the type (or quality of players transferred) - eg the transfer of Neymar from Barcelona has much stronger impact than multiple transfers in the EPL

2. Although thia chart is for all the Data however it still offers no filtering based on a particulae season
